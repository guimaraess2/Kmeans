# Kmeans 
Machine learning techniques have proven successful on classification issues of all types: medical diagnosis, character recognition, credit default and fraud prediction and also the foreign exchange market prognosis. Customer segmentation is a process of dividing customers into different groups, so that they can offer personalized services and customer experience. 
Customer segmentation allows a company to understand its customers and maximize profits based on its strengths and avoid risks, which can be caused by weaknesses. For this type of approach, the k-means algorithm proves to be very efficient, because it is able to separate the customers of a banking institution into groups and give a vision of what benefits fit for each group of these customers.
